_Score_ provides a developer-centric and platform-agnostic Workload specification to improve developer productivity and experience. Score eliminates configuration management between local and remote environments.

## Develop your Score Spec

To compose a Score Specification file, you'll do the following:

- Scope: identify containers, resources, and services needed for your infrastructure.
- Compose: compose your resources into the Score Specification file.
- Transform: transform your Score Specification file to the Platform of your choice.

## Getting started

To get started, you'll want to:

- Read through the [Overview page]({{< relref "/overview" >}} "Overview").
- Learn how to [install the score-compose reference implementation (CLI)]({{< relref "docs/score-implementation/score-compose#installation" >}} "Learn to install").

Beyond the getting started section, you can learn more about Score and how to implement it into your own workflows.
