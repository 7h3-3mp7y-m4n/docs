A Deployment Delta describes the changes that must be applied to one Deployment Set to generate another Deployment Set. Deployment Deltas are the only way to create new Deployment Sets.

Deployment Deltas can be created fully formed or combined through a PATCH method. They can also be generated from the difference between two Deployment Sets.
